   b-tektracker
   ============

   b-tektracker is an advanced MIDI step-sequencer.
it is a fork of tektracker by Billy Biggs (http://vektor.ca/audio/ttrk/),
which is not actively developed for now.
   
   README from tektracker distribution (v 0.7.0) follows:


   tektracker (ttrk)
   =================

  ttrk is the product of frustration with bad step editors found on
pretty much all MIDI sequencers available today.  I'm a big fan of
trackers, and I wanted to be able to compose MIDI music using a tracker
paradigm.

  There are five main goals of ttrk:

  1. Tracker-style step editor, think ScreamTracker3.
  2. Pattern based sequencer.
  3. Big, accessable track mute buttons, think Alesis MMT8.
  4. Realtime editing, never need to push stop.
  5. All functions directly accessable from the keyboard for rapid
     editing.

  ttrk started in the spring of 1999 as a Qt application.  I used it to
record a bunch of songs (http://mp3.com/bitblit) and some live shows,
but it was very much hacked together based on what I needed at the time.
Keeping a GUI app up to date is a pain in the ass, and ttrk has been in
need of a rewrite ever since.

  The urge to create a console version was two-fold:

  1. I wanted to use my old computer as a dedicated sequencer, and it
     doesn't run X.
  2. To create a sequencer, you need to run as root.  I don't like
     running big X apps as root.

  There are some files to help you use ttrk:

  - docs/keys.txt       Detailed explanation of all keyboard commands.
  - docs/usage.txt      Detailed notes on how to use ttrk.

  I hope that this application will be of some use to you.  If you find
any bugs or have any suggestions, please let me know.
