Version 0.8.2, Wed Aug 30 15:39:31 MSD 2006
- added config file option to toggle current row highlighting.

Tue Aug 29 21:13:25 EDT 2006 (Sam)
- added function to insert/delete rows to all channels in both pattern
and song mode.  Bound to keys shift-B and shift-D.  This can be
especially useful in song mode.
(Note that we could use other shifted alpha keys for more functions,
since I got rid of the uppercasing of keys in the main input loop.)
- added confirmation before saving over an existing filename
(did this after trashing a song accidentally by saving instead of loading...
D'OH!)
- when in pattern play mode say "Pattern" instead of "Playing" in 
the top status line
- ignore a few more special keys in inputBuffer()
- don't beep when non-piano alphanumeric keys are pressed (like A, 1, etc)
- added F1-F8 labels over each of the 8 on-screen channels.  Makes
it easier to tell which function key to press to mute/unmute a channel.
- added highlighting of the current row.
- implemented copy and paste in song mode.  These functions copy the 
entire channel (including pattern data and settigns such as volume,
midi channel, name, etc).  Useful for re-ordering your channels.
- also implemented row copy/paste in song mode.  These are bound
to shift-C and shift-V.  Note that pasting a row doesn't insert
a new row; instead it overwrites the pattern IDs in the current row.
If you want to insert pasted rows, use shift-B to insert some blank
rows first, then paste into the new rows.
You can also copy and paste a range of rows.  First move to one
end of the range and press shift-M to mark the row.  Then move
to the other end of the range and press shift-C to copy the range
of rows.  Finally move to the row where you want to paste, and press shift-V.

Version 0.8.1, Wed Aug 16 14:56:26 MSD 2006
- fixed inputBuffer() to ignore unknown keycodes and to use 
del and left_arrow keys as synonym to ^H 

Tue Aug 8 19:52:04 EDT 2006 (Sam)
- quit confirmation no longer requires pressing the Enter key
- added ability to play the current pattern in a loop; mapped
this function to F12 (used to be rewind song).  
While in pattern play mode, you can change to another pattern
(via PageUp/Down in pattern mode, or by moving to a different
row in song mode) and the new pattern will start to play after
the current pattern finishes. 
Use F9 to stop pattern play.

Mon Aug 7 12:56:19 EDT 2006 (Sam)
- when setting a note, only set the velocity (to the channel velocity)
if the row was blank.
- added confirmation when quitting

Fri Aug 4 21:50:59 EDT 2006 (Sam)
- added to song/sequence mode the ability to set a "NoteOff" pattern by
pressing the Backspace key.  Much like a NoteOff row in pattern mode,
a NoteOff pattern in a song silences that channel.

Wed Aug 2 22:10:23 EDT 2006 (Sam)
- in pattern mode, when not playing, notes are previewed as they are
entered.  Unlike version 0.8.0, there is no delay; the next key press is 
handled immediately.  Also, the note will continue to play until the next
key is pressed.  This seems more tracker-like to me.
- in song mode, you can now use the note entry keys to "jam".  This
is useful to play around with ideas (without having to enter notes
in pattern edit mode), or even to play in realtime while the song
is playing.  Note that you will need to set your keyboard repeat delay
to 250 ms for this to work properly.
In X:   xset r rate 250
In the Linux console:   kbdrate -d 250   # this is the default delay
- Before this version, notes always had a default velocity of 64 (or hex 40).
Now it is possible to override the default velocity for each channel.
The key '@' is used to set the channel velocity.
- changed the keys for transpose to '(' and ')', and updated the help page
(which didn't list the old keys (' and \) anyway)
- changed shiftNotes so that it also shifts the velocity and slide values
- remember name of last loaded or saved file, and use that as the default
value when the next load or save is invoked.
- changed the inputBuffer method so that it can be passed an initial value
(so far only used for filenames to be saved or loaded).  Also made sure
that you can't backspace beyond the beginning of the input area into
the prompt.

Version 0.8.0, Wed Apr 26 03:57:26 MSD 2006
- transport keys remapped, play from cursor added
- make status messages disappear after some time
- basic support for MIDI control changes (key '#' in pattern view)
- fill pattern(s) by control changes by given start and end values (linear interpolation, key '^W')
- input value command (key '='): input pattern numbers/note volumes/controller values directly.
- fixed error reporting for loading/saving song
- fixed tempo for loaded songs
- Delete row (^D) and Insert blank row (^B) commands
- note is played (and muted after delay) when inserted (in pattern view, only when song is'nt playing)
	parameter for that delay added to .ttrkrc (note_preview = time_in_tenth_of_second),
	default value is 5, 0 means "no note preview"
- SLang_input_pending(0) substituted by SLang_input_pending(1) which lowers cpu usage
- keyboard help is removed from the main views, separate help page added (key '?')

Version 0.7.0, Wed Jun 30 00:04:49 EDT 2004
 - update to newer autoconf
 - compile fixes for gcc-3

Version 0.6.8, Tue Feb 13 11:40:08 EST 2001
 - forgot to include config.h in screen.cpp

Version 0.6.7, Tue Feb 13 11:31:25 EST 2001
 - set the default RTC resolution down to 1024hz, since higher is too
   much for slower machines, and is more than necessary.
 - we now use a ttrkrc file, located in ~/.ttrkrc.   See
   docs/ttrkrc.sample.
 - now check for SLsmg_reinit_smg before using it.  This lets our app
   still work with older versions of slang.
 - we now check for slang installations where the slang include files
   are in either /usr/include/slang or $prefix/slang.
 - we now use the ttrkrc file for everything, no more setting
   environment variables.

Version 0.6.6,  Sun Feb 11 16:02:08 EST 2001
 - autoconf and automake'ed everything.  Makes it much more pleasant.

Version 0.6.5,  Sun Feb 11 12:14:12 EST 2001
 - added a #ifdef for kernel versions > 2.4.0 to let me use rtc.h
   (barknech@ph-cip.uni-koeln.de)
 - fixed the slide button '`' so that it properly moves down the cursor
   and refreshes.
